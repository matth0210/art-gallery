# PhotoGallery

Here is the small art gallery project I've created. Although the app is quite small and state management library like Ngrx is overkill,
I decided to implement it to show I'm somewhat familiar with it. This time around however, I used Ngrx/Data because I wanted to keep it as simple
as possible. However, this was my first time using Ngrx/Data and I'm not a huge fan and I'm unlikely to used it again. It tries to reduce boilerplate
code which it does somewhat successfully, but it is a little too restrictive and there is not much information online when troubleshooting.

I also would have like to write more unit tests that just the basic test scafolding, but given the time constraints and wanting to get this to you guys sooner than later
I've decided to hold off on that for now.

Lastly, I've sited a few sources where I got information from online. I had a custom infite-scroll solution somewhat working, but decided to use a third party package instead.
I also did some research on CSS grid and considered using that, but decided it would probably look better going with a flexbox approach.

I'm happy to talk about the decisions I made and why I made them in person. Looking forward to it.
